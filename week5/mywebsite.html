	<h2 class="r-title">Week 5 Project</h2>
	<p>This week we card sorted Nasa's Moon Website, our other project was to start coming up with ideas for our own website. With my career aiming towards website design and social media management, I thought it would be perfect to start designing a professional website. I did a little research and found a website that I'd like to mimic <a href=http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/47/51/1f4751aeb7c30099e4caf61393990fca.jpg>Example here</a>. It's going to take a lot of work, but I think it'll be well worth it for the future.

	<h2 class="r-title">Original Card Sort</h2>
	<p>The orignial card sorting is below, I though having the "Recent Projects" on the "Home" page would be good. Because that way when the visitors scroll down on the first page, they'll be able to see some of my work, which hopefully will impress/intrigue them to look at the other pages.

	<h2 class="r-title">Revised Card Sort</h2>
	<p>Originally I thought "Portfolio"" and "Credentials" should be grouped together in their own page. But after having others sort the cards, they came up with putting "Portfolio, "Credentials" and "Clients" together. Finally we decided that moving the "Services" tab in front of "Credentials" tabs would make more sense. Because visitors are coming to see what your services are before your credentials.
