	<p>This week we card sorted <a href=http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm>Nasa's Moon Website</a>, when I did the card sorting for the first time, I was confused for a number of reasons:
	</p>  
	<p>
	<div class= "notes">
		<ul>
		<li>Why wasn't Neil Armstrong under the "People" section?</li>
		<li>What did "Concepts" mean? under the "Missions and Programs" section.</li> 
		<li>Why was "Products" under the "Multi-Media" section?</li>
		<li>Shouldn't "Get Involved" be under "Multi-Media?"</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	Once I did the revisions, I removed Neil Armstrong and placed his content inside of the "People" section. I also moved "Get Involved" under the "Multi-Media" section, because multi-media could include social media..etc. Finally, I removed the "Concepts" and "Products" sections, because I didn't think they were relevant.
