	<p>This week we reviewed the Panic! webite, which had a clean and smooth design. We also learned about the box model in CSS (which includes the content, padding, border and margin.) Finally, we learned about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58KI-QUB-t0">Sketchnoting</a>, which I think is a cooler way to take notes! Check it out on Youtube at the link above! </p>
